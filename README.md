### What did we do?
We used [this data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) uploaded to reddit and extracted the comments from the start of 2011 to the end of 2013. We then extracted the comments that had their author labelled as either male or female (Ask Men and Ask Women have this option). 

This gave us 1,572,904 comments for our cause.

Huh? What is our cause? Well...




### Discriminating an authors gender from text
It's not as grand as curing world hunger and poverty but that's our area of expertise. Now, you may be thinking "What good can gender-discrimination do?" Apart from help answer questions about neurology and evolutionary psychology by showing how different people articulate their thoughts in different environments. Positive/negative opinion recognition was done along side gender-discrimination to help identify new information in these domains.

It could also be used to help chat bots talk to people. This is important when the chat bots are for support, such as for victims of abuse or those suffering from mental illness. 



If none of those catch your interest, you can use the algorithms to target ads better and make more money because of it. Yay money!

### What were the results?
We managed to distinguish between male and female commenters with non-random accuracy!

It's not cutting edge, but the tools we used were simple which shows that this is an interesting topic to study.

Out opinion recogniser didn't perform as well as we wanted to, although you can argue that it showing men and women aren't particularly different in positivity /negativity is somewhat heartwarming. We are all human!
